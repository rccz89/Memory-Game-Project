**#Memory Game Project**

**##Important Note**

This is the second project of the intermediate JavaScript section for Udacity's front-end web development nanodegree.

**##How the Game Works**

-The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. 
-The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.
-The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. 
-The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
